To publish each paragraph in Drupal, you generally need to make sure that your paragraphs (or content) are properly set to be "published" or "visible" on the site. There are a few key areas to look at in order to ensure this:
1. Paragraphs as Field Items:

    If you're using Paragraphs as a field on a content type (e.g., article, page), the individual paragraphs themselves don't have their own "published" status by default, as they are part of a parent entity (content node).
    The visibility of each paragraph is determined by the visibility settings of the parent node. So, when you publish the parent content, all paragraphs contained within that content are published.

2. Creating Paragraphs:

    When creating content (e.g., Article or Custom Content Type), add Paragraphs fields as part of the nodeâ€™s structure.
    While you are creating the node, ensure the node itself is published by setting its Published status to "Yes."

3. Paragraph Visibility Configuration:

If you want more granular control over the visibility or publishing status of individual paragraphs, you can consider these options:

    Custom Paragraph Type with Visibility Settings:
        You could add a "Published" field directly to the Paragraph content type.
        In this case, you would need to set up a custom field on each paragraph type to indicate whether it is published. This can be done by creating a Boolean field (e.g., Published) and then using a custom view mode or a hook to control the display based on this field.
    Module Support:
        The Paragraphs module itself doesn't natively support the concept of individual paragraph publishing, but you can leverage other modules to add this feature. Modules like Conditional Fields, Paragraphs Permissions, or Workflow can allow for more advanced control over when and how individual paragraphs are shown or hidden based on their state.

4. Using Workflow for Paragraphs:

    You can also set up a Workflow for managing when content (and paragraphs) is published. For example, you could set the workflow so that when a node is published, all included paragraphs become visible.
    For more fine-grained control, modules like Content Moderation or Workflows could help you manage drafts and publishing states more precisely.

5. Custom Code for Paragraph Publish:

If you need to ensure that each paragraph can be independently published or unpublished, you could write a custom module that listens for paragraph updates and triggers the publish status based on your own criteria.
Example Custom Module to Control Paragraph Publish:

/**
 * Implements hook_node_presave().
 */
function custom_module_node_presave(NodeInterface $node) {
    // Check if the node type is relevant and has paragraphs.
    if ($node->getType() == 'your_content_type') {
        $paragraph_field = $node->get('field_paragraphs');  // Adjust for your paragraph field machine name.

        foreach ($paragraph_field as $paragraph_item) {
            $paragraph = $paragraph_item->entity;
            
            // Check the status of each paragraph and set it to published.
            if ($paragraph && !$paragraph->isPublished()) {
                $paragraph->setPublished(TRUE);
                $paragraph->save();
            }
        }
    }
}

This code example would automatically set the paragraphs within a node as published when the node itself is published.
Conclusion:

    By default, in Drupal, paragraphs don't have independent "published" states; they inherit the published status of their parent node.
    For granular control, you can either use contributed modules like Content Moderation or Workflows, or customize your Drupal setup using custom fields and code to manage paragraph visibility.
